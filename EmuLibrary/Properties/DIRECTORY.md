## Assembly Information

The `AssemblyInfo.cs` file defines important metadata about the plugin assembly:

- **Version**: The current version number of the plugin
- **Title**: The display name of the assembly
- **Description**: A brief description of the plugin's functionality
- **Company**: The organization responsible for the plugin
- **Copyright**: Copyright information
- **GUID**: A unique identifier for the assembly

This information is used by .NET and Playnite to identify and categorize the plugin. The version number is particularly important as it's used by Playnite to determine when updates are available.
